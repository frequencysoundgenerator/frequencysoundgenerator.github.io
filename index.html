<h1>Frequency: Sound Generator</h1>

<div>
    Are you producing? Want to sound test your speakers or tune your instruments? Or simply, do you want to generate sounds and listen to the generated sounds in different frequencies? Well, then you need a frequency sound generator and
    sound analyzer to produce sound waves in different frequencies. Introducing <b>Frequency Sound Generator</b>! <br />
    Frequency Generator Sound player lets you generate a sine, square, sawtooth or triangle sound wave with a <b>frequency between 1Hz and 22000Hz (hertz)</b>. It produces accurate tone &amp; soundwaves while being simple and easy to use.
    <br />
    No matter if you need to sound test and generate high frequency sounds or low frequency sounds, our frequency tone generator is your #1 best solution.<br />
    <br />
    ▶️<b>EASY CONTROL</b><br />
    Frequency Sound Generator allows you to easily change the soundwaves from the main menu. Simply tap on the sound wave icon and pick between sine, square, sawtooth or triangle. Additionally, pick from a wide variety of notes by taping
    the notes 🎵 icon.<br />
    <br />
    📲<b>ANIMATED SOUND WAVE</b><br />
    You’ll love the animated sound wave function which visually represents the sound for a given frequency. You can change waveform by clicking on a round button at the left side and get a different sound and animated wave. <br />
    <br />
    🎚️<b>ADJUST FREQUENCY &amp; VOLUME</b><br />
    Adjust the sound generating frequency easily by dragging the yellow dot. Make use of the - &amp; + buttons for added adjusting precision. Additionally, control the volume of the generated sounds from 0-100%.<br />
    <br />
    🔊<b>NUMEROUS USES:</b><br />
    This sound generating app can be used in multiple use cases:<br />
    ● <b>Test your hearing</b>. A human being is capable of hearing frequencies in the average range of 20Hz-20000Hz. This range is getting smaller by age, so it’s interesting to sound test your hearing capabilities.<br />
    ● <b>Test speakers and headphones</b> for the high end (treble) and low end (bass) tones.<br />
    ● Use this app as an <b>instrument tuner</b> when playing or producing.<br />
    ● <b>Cleaning water</b> from the speaker. Since sound is making small vibrations it can help to shake off unwanted water from your speakers.<br />
    ● Find your <b>tinnitus frequency</b>.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>NOTE</b>: Since mobile phones are not high-quality audio sources and in-built speakers may vary in quality, sometimes users can hear sounds at very low or high frequencies even beyond the scope of human hearing. That noise is not
    sound of a given frequency but static or “parasite” noise generated by your mobile device. For the best experience use a pair of good quality headphones.
